Designing software means figuring out how to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller, easier tasks. While working on the 3D scene project, I got better at organizing tasks, picking the right tools, and creating clear and simple designs. I started by planning the basic structure, then added details step by step, testing and improving along the way. The careful planning and regular testing I did in this project will be useful in future projects too.

When I develop programs, I begin by understanding what needs to be done, then I write and test the code bit by bit. During this project, I learned new ways to organize my code so it's easier to manage and update. Making improvements through repeated testing was key to getting the final product right. Over time, my approach to coding became more organized and thoughtful, which helped me finish the project well.

Computer science can help me reach my goals by giving me the skills to solve problems and create useful things. Working with graphics and visualizations has taught me how to show information in a visual way, which is very useful for both learning and work. These skills will be important in the future, helping me to understand complex information in school and to create effective visual solutions in my career.
